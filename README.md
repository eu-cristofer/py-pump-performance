# py-pump-performance
 Pump Performance is a set of tools to help engineers and technicians to asses the condition of an API 610 pump during its Performance and Mechanical Running Test trials.


# Resources
* Performance computation
* Operational curves generation
* Speed correction
* Relative density correction
* Viscous effects correction
* Report issue automation


## Technical specifications

The solution was written in Python 3.

The performance acceptance criteria adopted in this project is the API 610 11th edition, Centrifugal pumps for petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries.

The computation of test parameters follows the ANSI/HI 14.6 Rotodynamic Pumps - Hydraulic Performance Acceptance Tests.

The computation of viscosity correction is accordingly the ANSI/HI 9.6 Rotodynamic Pumps -  Guideline for Effects of Liquid Viscosity on Performance.
